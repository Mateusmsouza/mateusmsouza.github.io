# Graph Thoery: Maximal, Minimal, Maximum and Minimum

Bonsoir my friend, in this article we'll quickly be discussing the difference between maximal, minimal, maximum and minimum concepts applying them to graph theory.

Maximal

We can define Maximal in Graph Theory as:

- Let F' be a set of subgraphs from G, a member F of F' is maximal if no other member of F' has F as subgraph.

    *(In other words, F is not a proper contained by any other graph in F')*

    *(in other words, F is the biggest subgraph of F')*

Minimal

Therefore, we can define Minimal in Graph Theory like:

- Let F' be a set of subgraphs from G, a member F of F' is a minimal if it has no other member of F' as a subgraph.

    *(In other words, F does not properly contains any other subgraph in F')*

    *(in other words, F is the smallest subgraph of F')*

Maximum

Let X be a subset of set A. 

- We could say X is maximum if there's no other subset Y in A such is has bigger cardinality than X.

    *(In other words, X is maximum if there is no other Y ∈ A such |Y| > |X|.)*

    > Proposition: Every Maximum is a Maximal, but not every Minimum is a Minimal.

Minimum

Let X be a subset of set A. 

- We could say X is minimum if there's no other subset Y in A such is has smaller cardinality than X.

    *(In other words, X is* minimum *if there is no other Y ∈ A such |Y| < |X|.)*
