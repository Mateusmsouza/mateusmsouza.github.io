Bonsoir friend, we'll quickly be discussing the difference between maximal, minimal, maximum, and minimum concepts applying them to graph theory.

Maximal

We can define Maximal in Graph Theory as:

- Let F' be a set of subgraphs from G, a member F of F' is maximal if no other member of F' has F as a subgraph.

    *(In other words, F is not contained by any graph in F')*

    *(in other words, F is the biggest subgraph of F')*

Minimal

Therefore, we can define Minimal in Graph Theory like:

- Let F' be a set of subgraphs from G, a member F of F' is minimal if it has no member of F' as a subgraph.

    *(In other words, F does not contain any other subgraph in F')*

    *(in other words, F is the smallest subgraph of F')*

Maximum

Let X be a subset of set A. 

- We could say X is maximum if there's no other subset Y in A such it has bigger cardinality than X.

    *(In other words, X is maximum if there is no other Y ∈ A such |Y| > |X|.)*

    > Proposition: Every Maximum is Maximal, but not every Minimum is Minimal.

Minimum

Let X be a subset of set A. 

- We could say X is minimum if there's no other subset Y in A such it has smaller cardinality than X.

    *(In other words, X is* minimum *if there is no other Y ∈ A such |Y| < |X|.)*
