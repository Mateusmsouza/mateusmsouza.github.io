Hi! I’m Mateus, a Brazilian researcher and software developer.

I graduated from [Fatec São José dos Campos](http://sjc.fatec.sp.gov.br/) and am currently pursuing my master’s degree at [ICT/Unifesp](https://www.unifesp.br/campus/sjc/).

When it comes to work, I’ve got solid experience developing and maintaining enterprise services, mostly using Python. I’m also pretty familiar with infrastructure tools like IaC, Ansible, Kubernetes, and a few others.

As a researcher, I’m passionate about deep learning and improving the robustness of computer vision models. You can check out my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=0MMI9vsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&gmla=AL3_zijqKTklgdByeT1skYqqpvXwFJJzW2cKGn5CMCZ4U03pgsdpgGRc0Fvoj3DNggaGPxqJy1W_kYB1tftrmo-9) for more details on my work.

This blog is where I share my experiences, research, and interests—mostly about software, infrastructure, and deep learning, but I like to throw in some non-tech stuff every now and then too.
